Game created with JavaScript and PixiJS.


Running the game:

You will need to run a web server with PixiJS. Web browsers prevent loading local files (such as images and audio files) on locally loaded web pages. If you just double-click the HTML file, you'll get an error when you try to add a sprite to the PixiJS stage. This game is using Mongoose as a web serveer.

To run this game with Mongoose, go to the Mongoose download page https://mongoose.ws/ and download the free server for your operating system. Mongoose defaults to serving the files in the folder it's run in, so copy the downloaded executable into the main game folder (i.e. the one with Index.html and this README file in it). 

Double-click the Mongoose executable, tell your operating system that you trust the file to run, and you'll have a running web server for the game.
To run the game, right click on the red Mongoose icon in the bottom right-hand corner of your tray icon and select "go to local url". This will take you to a running instance of the game.
